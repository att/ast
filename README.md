# KSH93

This repository contains the AT&amp;T Software Technology (AST) toolkit
from AT&amp;T Research.  As of November 2017 the development focus has
been shifted to the `ksh93` command and libraries required to build
it. See below for details on which branches contain the full AST code.

## Building

Building ksh93 requires the Meson build system.

To build it, execute These commands from the project root directory:

```
meson build
ninja -C build
```

## Testing

All test cases can be run from `build` directory with:

```
meson test
```

If your system has an old version of Meson you may need to run `mesontest`
(notice the missing space).

To run a specific unit test simply append it's name minus the `.sh` extension 
suffix. For example,

```
meson test builtins
```

## Installing

Ksh executable, helper library and man page can be installed from `build` directory with:

```
ninja install
```

## Working with the full AST source

Full AST source code is available under the `2012-08-01-master` and
`2016-01-10-beta` branches (see below for more details). Bug fixes to
these branches are welcome but they are otherwise under low maintenance.

The full AST code includes many tools and libraries, like KSH, NMAKE, SFIO,
VMALLOC, VCODEX, etc. It also includes more efficient replacements for a
lot of the POSIX tools.  It was designed to be portable across many UNIX
systems and also works under UWIN on Microsoft Windows (see UWIN repo on
GitHub under att/uwin).

This software is used to build itself, using NMAKE.
After cloning this repo, cd to the top directory of it and run:

```
./bin/package make
```

Almost all the tools in this package (including the bin/package script are
self-documenting; run <tool> --man (or --html) for the man page for the tool.

(If you were used to the old AST packaging mechanism, on www.research.att.com,
this repo is equivalent to downloading the INIT and ast-open packages and
running: ./bin/package read on them).

## Branches

The `master` [branch](https://github.com/att/ast/commits/master) contains the current development version of ksh93. It only contains source code for ksh93 and the libraries required to build it.

The `2012-08-01-master` [branch](https://github.com/att/ast/commits/2012-08-01-master) contains the the last stable release of full AST source code. It contains one cherry-picked [change](https://github.com/att/ast/commit/e79c29295092fe2b2282d134e2b7cce32ec9dcac) to allow building on Linux.

The `2016-01-10-beta` [branch](https://github.com/att/ast/commits/2016-01-10-beta) contains the last beta release of full AST source code plus a number of patches that were later added on top of it.

The `gh-pages` [branch](https://github.com/att/ast/commits/gh-pages) will probably be removed. It contains files needed to generate the static [AST project page](https://att.github.io/ast/) hosted by Github. See https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/ for more info.
