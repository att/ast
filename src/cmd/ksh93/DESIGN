Here is an overview of the source code organization for ksh93.

Directory layout:

	The directory include contains header files for ksh93.
	The files nval.h and shell.h are intended to be public
	headers and can be used to add runtime builtin command.
	The remainder are private.

	The directory data contains readonly data files for ksh93.
	The man pages for built-ins are in builtins.c rather
	than included as statics with the implementations in the
	bltins directory because some systems don't make static const
	data readonly and we want these to be shared by all running
	shells.

	The directory edit contains the code for command line
	editing and history.

	The fun directory contains some shell function such as
	pushd, popd, and dirs.

	The directory features contains files that are used to generate
	header files in the FEATURE directory.  Most of these files
	are in a format that is processed by iffe.

	The directory bltins contains code for most of the built-in
	commands.  Additional built-in commands are part of libcmd.

	The directory sh contains most of the code for ksh93.

	The directory tests contains a number of regression tests.
	In most cases, when a bug gets fixed, a test is added to
	one of these files.  The regression tests can be run by
	going to this directory and running
		SHELL=shell_path shell_path shtests
	where shell_path is an absolute pathname for the shell to
	be tested.

	The top level directory contains the nmake Makefile, the
        RELEASE file, the ksh93 man file (sh.1) and nval.3 and shell.3
        documentation files. The RELEASE file contains the list of bug
	fixes and new features since the original ksh93 release.  The file
	COMPATIBILITY is a list of all known incompatibilities with ksh88.

	The  data/bash_pre_rc.sh is a startup script used when emulating
	bash if the shell is compiled with SHOPT_BASH and the shell
	is invoked as bash.  The bash emulation is not complete.

		commands.
	22.	timeout.h contains the define constant for the maximum
		shell timeout.
	23.	ulimit.h includes the appropriate resource header.
	24.	variables.h contains symbolic constants for the built-in
		shell variables.

		handling and termination.

		at a time from a file or string.
	11.	init.c contains initialization code and callbacks
		for get and set functions for built-in variables.
	12.	io.c contains code for redirections and managing file
		descriptors and file streams.
