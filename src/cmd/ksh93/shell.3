.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIShell\fP library is a set of functions used for
writing extensions to \f5ksh\fP or writing commands
that embed shell command processing.
The include file \f5<shell.h>\fP contains the type definitions,
function prototypes and symbolic constants defined by
this interface.  It also defines replacement definitions for
the standard library functions
\f5access()\fP,
\f5close()\fP,
\f5dup()\fP,
\f5exit()\fP,
\f5fcntl()\fP,
\f5lseek()\fP,
\f5open()\fP,
\f5pipe()\fP,
\f5read()\fP,
and
\f5write()\fP
that must be used
with all code
intended to be compiled as built-in commands.
.P
The \f5<shell.h>\fP header includes \f5<ast.h>\fP which
in turn includes the standard include files, \f5<stddef.h>\fP,
\f5<stdlib.h>\fP, \f5<stdarg.h>\fP, \f5<limits.h>\fP,
\f5<stdio.h>\fP, \f5<string.h>\fP, \f5<unistd.h>\fP,
\f5<sys/types.h>\fP, \f5<fcntl.h>\fP, and \f5<locale.h>\fP.
The \f5<shell.h>\fP header also includes the headers
\f5<cdt.h>\fP,
\f5<cmd.h>\fP,
\f5<sfio.h>\fP,
\f5<nval.h>\fP,
\f5<stk.h>\fP,
and \f5<error.h>\fP
so that in most cases, programs only require the single
header \f5<shell.h>\fP.
.PP
Programs can use this library in one of the following ways:
.PD 0
.TP
.B 1
To write builtin commands and/or other code that will be loaded
into the shell by loading dynamic libraries
at run time using the \f5builtin\fP(1) command.
In this case the shell will look for a function named \f5lib_init\fP
in your library and, if found, will execute this function with
two arguments.  The first
argument will be an \f5int\fP with value \f50\fP when the library is loaded.
The second argument will contain a pointer to a structure of type
\f5Shbltin_t\fP.
In addition, for each argument named on the \f5builtin\fP
command line, it will look for a function named \f5b_\fP\fIname\fP\f5()\fP
in your library and will \fIname\fP as a built-in.
.TP
.B 2
To build separate a separate command that uses the shell as a
library at compile or run time.
In this case the \f5sh_init()\fP function must be called to
initialize this library before any other commands in this library
are invoked.
The arguments \fIargc\fP and \fIargv\fP are the number
of arguments and the vector of arguments as supplied by the shell.
It returns a pointer the \f5Shell_t\fP.
.TP
.B 3
To build a new version of \f5ksh\fP with extended capabilities,
for example \f5tksh\fP(1).
In this case, the user writes a \f5main()\fP function that
calls \f5sh_main()\fP with the \fIargc\fP and \fIargv\fP arguments
from \f5main\fP and pointer to function, \fIfn\fP as a third
argument..  The function \fIfn\fP will
be invoked with argument \f50\fP after \f5ksh\fP has done initialization,
but before \f5ksh\fP has processed any start up files or executed
any commands.  The function \fIfn\fP
will be invoked with an argument of \f51\fP before \f5ksh\fP
begins to execute a script that has been invoked by name
since \f5ksh\fP cleans up memory and long jumps back to
the beginning of the shell in this case.
The function \fIfn\fP will be called with argument \f5-1\fP before
the shell exits.
.PD
.PP
The \f5Shell_t\fP structure contains the following fields:
.nf
.ft 5
	Shopt_t	\fIoptions\fP;		\fR/* set -o options */\fP
	Dt_t	*\fIvar_tree\fP;		\fR/* shell variable dictionary */\fP
	Dt_t	*\fIfun_tree\fP;		\fR/* shell function dictionary */\fP
	Dt_t	*\fIalias_tree\fP;		\fR/* shell alias dictionary */\fP
	Dt_t	*\fIbltin_tree\fP;		\fR/* shell built-in dictionary */\fP
	Shscope_t	*\fItopscope\fP;		\fR/* pointer to top-level scope */\fP
	char	*\fIinfile_name\fP;	\fR/* path name of current input file*/\fP
	int	\fIinlineno\fP;		\fR/* line number of current input file*/\fP
	int	\fIexitval\fP;		\fR/* most recent exit value*/\fP
.ft R
.fi
This structure is returned by \f5sh_init()\fP but can also be retrieved
by a call to \f5sh_getinterp()\fP.
.PP
All built-in commands to the shell are invoked with
three arguments.  The first two arguments give the
number of arguments and the argument list
and uses the same conventions as the \f5main()\fP function
of a program.  The third argument is a pointer to a structure
of type \f5Shbltin_t\fP.  This structure contains \f5shp\fP which is a pointer
to the shell interpreter, and \f5ptr\fP which is a pointer that
can be associated with each built-in.
The \f5sh_addbuiltin()\fP function is used to add, replace or delete
built-in commands. 
It takes the name of the built-in, \fIname\fP, a pointer
to the function that implements the built-in, \fIfn\fP, and
a pointer that will be passed to the function in the \f5ptr\fP field when
it is invoked.
If, \fIfn\fP is non-\f5NULL\fP the built-in command
is added or replaced.  Otherwise, \f5sh_addbuiltin()\fP will
return a pointer to the built-in if it exists or \f5NULL\fP otherwise.
If \fIarg\fP is \f5(void*)1\fP the built-in will be deleted.
The \fIname\fP argument can be in the format of a pathname.
It cannot be the name of any of the special built-in commands.
If \fIname\fP contains a \f5/\fP, the built-in is the basename of
the pathname and the built-in will only be executed
if the given pathname is encountered when performing
a path search.
When adding or replacing a built-in,
\f5sh_addbuiltin()\fP function returns a pointer to
the name-value pair corresponding to the built-in on success and \f5NULL\fP
if it is unable to add or replace the built-in.
When deleting a built-in, \f5NULL\fP is returned on success or
if not found, and the name-value pair pointer is returned if the built-in
cannot be deleted.
.PP
The functions \f5sh_onoption()\fP, \f5sh_offoption()\fP, \f5sh_isoption()\fP
are used to set, unset, and test for shell options respectively.
The \fIoption\fP argument can be any one of the following:
.IP
\f5SH_ALLEXPORT\fP:
The \f5NV_EXPORT\fP attribute is given to each variable whose
name is an identifier when a value is assigned.
.IP
\f5SH_BGNICE\fP:
Each background process is run at a lower priority.
.IP
\f5SH_ERREXIT\fP:
Causes a non-interactive shell to exit when a command,
other than a conditional command, returns non-zero.
.IP
\f5SH_EMACS\fP:
The emacs editing mode.
.IP
\f5SH_GMACS\fP:
Same as the emacs editing mode except for the behavior of CONTROL-T.
.IP
\f5SH_HISTORY\fP:
Indicates that the history file has been created and that
commands can be logged.
.IP
\f5SH_IGNOREEOF\fP:
Do not treat end-of-file as exit.
.IP
\f5SH_INTERACTIVE\fP:
.IP
Set for interactive shells.
Do not set or unset this option.
\f5SH_MARKDIRS\fP:
A \fB/\fP is added to the end of each directory generated by pathname
expansion.
.IP
\f5SH_MONITOR\fP:
Indicates that the monitor option is enabled for job control.
.IP
\f5SH_NOCLOBBER\fP:
The \fB>\fP redirection will fail if the file exists.  Each file
created with \fB>\fP will have the \f5O_EXCL\fP bit set as described
in \f5<fcntl.h>\fP
.IP
\f5SH_NOGLOB\fP:
Do not perform pathname expansion.
.IP
\f5SH_NOLOG\fP:
Do not save function definitions in the history file.
.IP
\f5SH_NOTIFY\fP:
Cause a message to be generated as soon as each background job completes.
.IP
\f5SH_NOUNSET\fP:
Cause the shell to fail with an error of an unset variable is
referenced.
.IP
\f5SH_PRIVILEGED\fP:
.IP
\f5SH_VERBOSE\fP:
Cause each line to be echoed as it is read by the parser.
.IP
\f5SH_XTRACE\fP:
Cause each command to be displayed after all expansions, but
before execution.
.IP
\f5SH_VI\fP:
The vi edit mode.
.IP
\f5SH_VIRAW\fP:
Read character at a time rather than line at a time when
in vi edit mode.
.IP
.PP
The \f5sh_trap()\fP function can be used to compile and execute
a string or file.
A value of \f50\fP for \fImode\fP indicates that \fIname\fP
refers to a string.  A value of \f51\fP for \fImode\fP
indicates that \fIname\fP is an \f5Sfio_t*\fP to an open stream.
A value of \f52\fP for \fImode\fP indicates that \fIname\fP
points to a parse tree that has been returned by \f5sh_parse()\fP.
The complete file associated with the string or file
is compiled and then executed so that aliases defined
within the string or file will not take effect until
the next command is executed.
.PP
The \f5sh_run()\fP function will run the command given by
by the argument list \fIargv\fP containing \fIargc\fP elements. 
If \fIargv\fP\f5[0]\fP does not contain a \f5/\fP, it will
be checked to see if it is a built-in or function before
performing a path search. 
.PP
The \f5sh_eval()\fP function executes a string or file
stream \fIsp\fP.
If \fImode\fP is non-zero and the history file has
been created, the stream defined by \fIsp\fP
will be appended to the history file as a command.
.PP
The \f5sh_parse()\fP function takes a pointer to the
shell interpreter \fIshp\fP, a pointer to a string or file stream
\fIsp\fP, and compilation flags, and returns a pointer
to a parse tree of the compiled stream.  This pointer can
be used in subsequent calls to \f5sh_trap()\fP.
The compilation flags can be zero or more of the following:
.IP
\f5SH_NL\fP:
Treat new-lines as \fB;\fP.
.IP
\f5SH_EOF\fP:
An end of file causes syntax error.  By default it will
be treated as a new-line.
.PP
\f5ksh\fP executes each function defined with the \f5function\fP
reserved word in a separate scope.  The \f5Shscope_t\fP type
provides an interface to some of the information that
is available on each scope.  The structure contains
the following public members:
.nf
      \f5Sh_scope_t      *par_scope;\fP
      \f5int             argc;\fP
      \f5char            **argv;\fP
      \f5char            *cmdname;\fP
      \f5Dt_t      	 *var_tree;\fP
.fi
The \f5sh_getscope()\fP function can be used to the the
scope information associated with existing scope.
Scopes are numbered from \f50\fP for the global scope
up to the current scope level.  The \fIwhence\fP
argument uses the symbolic constants associated with \f5lseek()\fP
to indicate whether the \f5Iscope\fP argument is absolute,
relative to the current scope, or relative to the topmost scope.
The\f5sh_setscope()\fP function can be used to make a
a known scope the current scope.  It returns a pointer to the
old current scope.
.PP
The \f5sh_funscope()\fP function can be used to run a function
in a new scope.  The arguments \fIargc\fP and \fIargv\fP
are the number of arguments and the list of arguments
respectively.  If \fIfn\fP is non-\f5NULL\fP, then
this function is invoked with \fIargc\fP, \fIargv\fP, and \fIarg\fP
as arguments.
.PP
The \f5sh_fun()\fP function can be called within a
discipline function or built-in extension to execute a
discipline function script. 
The argument \fIfunnode\fP is a pointer to the shell function
or built-in to execute.
The argument \fIvarnode\fP is a pointer to the name
value pair that has defined this discipline.
The array \fIargv\fP is a \f5NULL\fP terminated list of
arguments that are passed to the function. 
.PP
By default, \f5ksh\fP only records but does not act
on signals when running a built-in command.
If a built-in takes a substantial amount of time
to execute, then it should check for interrupts
periodically by calling \f5sh_sigcheck()\fP.
If a signal is pending, \f5sh_sigcheck()\fP will exit
the function you are calling and return to the point
where the most recent built-in was invoked, or where
\f5sh_eval()\fP or \f5sh_trap()\fP was called.
.PP
The \f5sh_delay()\fP function is used to cause the
shell to sleep for a period of time defined by \fIsec\fP.
.PP
The \f5sh_fmtq()\fP function can be used to convert a string
into a string that is quoted so that it can be reinput
to the shell. The quoted string returned by \f5sh_fmtq\fP
may be returned on the current stack, so that it
must be saved or copied.
.PP
The \f5sh_fdnotify()\fP function causes the function \fIfn\fP
to be called whenever the shell duplicates or closes a file.
It is provided for extensions that need to keep track of
file descriptors that could be changed by shell commands.
The function \fIfn\fP is called with two arguments.
The first argument is the original file descriptor.  The
second argument is the new file descriptor for duplicating
files, and \f5SH_FDCLOSE\fP when a file has been closed.
The previously installed \f5sh_fdnotify()\fP function pointer
is returned.
.PP
The \f5sh_waitnotify()\fP function causes the function \fIfn\fP
to be called whenever the shell is waiting for input from
a slow device or waiting for a process to complete.
This function can process events and run shell commands
until there is input, the timer is reached or a signal arises.
It is called with three arguments. The first is the file
descriptor from which the shell trying to read  or \f5\-1\fP
if the shell is waiting for a process to complete.
The second is a timeout in milliseconds.
A value of \f5\-1\fP for the timeout means that
no timeout should be set.
The third argument is 0 for input file descriptors
and 1 for output file descriptor. 
The function needs to return a value \f5>0\fP if there
is input on the file descriptor, and a value \f5<0\fP
if the timeout is reached or a signal has occurred.
A value of \f50\fP indicates
that the function has returned without processing and that the shell
should wait for input or process completion.
The previous installed \f5sh_waitnotify()\fP function pointer is returned.
.PP
The \f5sh_iogetiop()\fP function returns a pointer to the
Sfio stream corresponding to file descriptor number \fIfd\fP
and the given mode \fImode\fP.  The mode can be either
\f5SF_READ\fP or \f5SF_WRITE\fP.
The \fIfd\fP argument can the number of an open file descriptor or
one of the following symbolic constants:
.IP
\f5SH_IOCOPROCESS\fP:
The stream corresponding to the most recent co-process.
.IP
\f5SH_IOHISTFILE\fP:
The stream corresponding to the history file.
If no stream exists corresponding to \fIfd\fP or the stream
can not be accessed in the specified mode, \f5NULL\fP is returned.
