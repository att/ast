.SH SYNOPSIS

basename [flags] string [suffix]
basename [flags] string...
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBbasename\fP removes all leading directory components from the file name
defined by \fIstring\fP\&. If the file name defined by \fIstring\fP has a suffix
that ends in \fIsuffix\fP, it is removed as well.
.sp
If \fIstring\fP consists solely of \fB/\fP characters the output will be a
single \fB/\fP\&. Trailing \fB/\fP characters are removed, and if there are
any remaining \fB/\fP characters in \fIstring\fP, all characters up to and
including the last \fB/\fP are removed. Finally, if \fIsuffix\fP is specified,
and is identical the end of \fIstring\fP, these characters are removed. The
characters not removed from \fIstring\fP will be written on a single line to
the standard output.
.sp
\fBThis command is not enabled by default.\fP To enable it run \fBbuiltin basename\fP\&.
