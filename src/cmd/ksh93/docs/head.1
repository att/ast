[+NAME?head - output beginning portion of one or more files ]
[+DESCRIPTION?\bhead\b copies one or more input files to standard output stopping at a designated point for each file or to the end of the file whichever comes first. Copying ends at the point indicated by the options. By default a header of the form \b==> \b\afilename\a\b <==\b is output before all but the first file but this can be changed with the \b-q\b and \b-v\b options.]
[+?If no \afile\a is given, or if the \afile\a is \b-\b, \bhead\b copies from standard input starting at the current location.]
[+?The option argument for \b-c\b, and \b-s\b can optionally be followed by one of the following characters to specify a different unit other than a single byte:]
{
[+b?512 bytes.]
[+k?1-killobyte.]
[+m?1-megabyte.]
}
[+?For backwards compatibility, \b-\b\anumber\a is equivalent to \b-n\b \anumber\a.]
