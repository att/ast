:index:`basename` -- strip directory and suffix from filenames
==============================================================

Synopsis

Description
-----------
`basename` removes all leading directory components from the file name
defined by *string*. If the file name defined by *string* has a suffix
that ends in *suffix*, it is removed as well.

If *string* consists solely of **/** characters the output will be a
single **/**. Trailing **/** characters are removed, and if there are
any remaining **/** characters in *string*, all characters up to and
including the last **/** are removed. Finally, if *suffix* is specified,
and is identical the end of *string*, these characters are removed. The
characters not removed from *string* will be written on a single line to
the standard output.
