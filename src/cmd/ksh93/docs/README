All reStructuredText (*.rst) files should follow the usual rules for line
length such as imposted on the C source modules. That is, keep lines to
100 chars or less. Use the features of reStructuredText to automatically
concatenate lines.

The *.1 files in this directory don't follow the usual rules for line
length as imposed on C source modules and other files such as this
readme. Each paragraph should be a single line. This helps ensure that line
wraps are made by the presentation mechanism which is in the best position
to adapt the output to the display width. They will be removed once the
conversion to Sphinx/reStructuredText based documentation is complete.
