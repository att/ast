This directory contains the standalone code for ipv6 address longest
prefix match using an interval dictionary. ivsa requires the ast
standalone astsa source package.  Read this package and astsa in the
same directory, read README-astsa, and then run this to build libivsa.a:

	make -f ivsa.omk

and this to build the test harness and test the library:

	make -f ivsa.omk test

You may have to do some /bin/make plumbing on *.omk to get it to work
on your system.  If you already have the non-standalone libast installed
then you should be able to compile and link just the standalone ivsa
against it.

The library interface is implemented in libivsa.a; include iv.h in your
source and link your a.out with libivsa.a.  ivsa.omk (for old make) pulls
in standalone headers and source.

'testiv --man' lists the test harness man page on the standard error.
iv.3 is the api man page.  See testiv.c for example api usage.

ivsa is a subset of the { ast-base ast-dss } packages at
