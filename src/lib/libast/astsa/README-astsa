astsa implements a small subset of the ast library for other ast
standalone commands and libraries using X/Open interfaces. 

To get better performance and functionality, consider using any of
the full-featured ast-* packages at

	http://www.research.att.com/sw/download/

If you already have non-standalone ast installed then you don't
need any of the astsa apis.

If you already have non-standalone versions of any of

	aso cdt sfio vmalloc

installed then run this with the api args you already have before
running the first make:

	./astsastd [ aso ] [ cdt ] [ sfio ] [ vmalloc ]

astsa.omk is an old make makefile that builds the headers and objects
and defines these variables for use in other makefiles

	ASTSA_OPTIMIZE	``-O'' by default

The astsa files may be combined in a single directory with other ast
standalone packages.
