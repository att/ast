// Return small format buffer chunk of size n. Small buffers thread safe but short-lived. This must
// only be used by the code in the libast/string directory. And only for functions that format
// relatively small strings (e.g., less than a kilobyte). Such as might be done when converting a
// binary int to a string.
//
// This API is inherently risky since there is no formal acquire/release semantics. We simply assume
// we'll never be asked to provide more than a small number of psuedo-static buffers that are in use
// at any point in time. This allows uses like
//
//    printf("%s %s %s\n", fmtint(x), fmtint(y), fmtint(z));
//
// This allows users of this API to avoid having to resort to a single static buffer that then
// requires the callers of those functions to `strdup()` the buffer. Or the users of this API having
// to always return a `malloc()` buffer that their caller then has to explicitly free.
//
// See https://github.com/att/ast/issues/962
